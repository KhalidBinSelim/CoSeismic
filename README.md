## Project Overview
**This project focuses on developing an energy-efficient solution for analyzing seismic data collected from planetary missions such as Apollo and the Mars InSight Lander.** The primary objective is to differentiate between noise and genuine seismic events, optimizing the amount of data sent back to Earth by identifying only useful signals. Given the challenges of transmitting continuous seismic data over long distances, this solution is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of seismic event detection, ultimately reducing power consumption.

## Problem Statement
**Planetary seismology is constrained by the high power requirements needed to transmit large amounts of continuous seismic data.** However, only a small fraction of this data is scientifically useful. This project seeks to create an algorithm that filters out noise and identifies seismic events within the data, sending only relevant information back to Earth.

## Objectives
- **Develop an algorithm to analyze seismic data from the Apollo missions and Mars InSight Lander.**
- **Filter noise and detect genuine seismic events within the dataset.**
- **Optimize energy usage by transmitting only relevant seismic data.**
- **Use machine learning techniques or conventional algorithms (e.g., STA/LTA) to enhance detection accuracy.**

## Solution Approach
**We have implemented an algorithm that processes seismic data by analyzing both cataloged and uncatalogued datasets.** Our approach allows the system to:
- Identify seismic signals with high accuracy.
- Filter out irrelevant data to reduce the transmission load.
- Handle missing data and glitches, which are common in planetary seismic records.

Machine learning models were also explored to improve accuracy in detecting seismic quakes in planetary environments, as these signals can differ significantly from those observed on Earth.

## Data and Resources
**The project uses real seismic data from:**
- **Apollo Missions**: Lunar seismic data.
- **Mars InSight Lander**: Seismic data from Mars.

The datasets include continuous seismic records, catalogs of known seismic events, and test data for further analysis.

## Usage
**The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed instructions on how to run the seismic analysis and visualize the data.** You can modify the provided algorithms to enhance the detection of seismic quakes or use machine learning models for more complex analysis.

## Results
**Our model achieved significant accuracy in detecting seismic events from planetary data.** By applying signal processing techniques, we were able to reduce noise interference and identify previously unrecorded seismic events.

## Future Work
**We plan to:**
- Further optimize the energy efficiency of the algorithm for real-time onboard use in future space missions.
- Explore additional machine learning techniques to improve detection in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.
