# Optimizing Seismic Detection for Planetary Missions Across the Solar System

</div>

The exploration of seismic activity on distant planets holds the potential to reveal crucial information about their internal structures. However, detecting true seismic quakes amidst noise from environmental interference and spacecraft disturbances presents a significant challenge. We, team **ONURONON**, are addressing this problem as part of the **“Seismic Detection Across the Solar System”** challenge. Our mission is to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of seismic data transfer from celestial bodies like the Moon and Mars, while reducing energy consumption.

## Problem Statement

Planetary seismology missions struggle with the power requirements necessary to send continuous seismic data back to Earth. But only a fraction of this data is scientifically useful! Instead of sending back all the data collected, what if we could program a lander to distinguish signals from noise, and send back only the data we care about? Your challenge is to write a computer program to analyze real data from the Apollo missions and the Mars InSight Lander to identify seismic quakes within the noise!

## Objectives

- **Develop an algorithm** to analyze seismic data from the Apollo missions and Mars InSight Lander.
- **Filter noise and detect genuine seismic events** within the dataset.
- **Optimize energy usage** by transmitting only relevant seismic data.
- **Use machine learning techniques or conventional algorithms (e.g., STA/LTA)** to enhance detection accuracy.

## Solution Procedures

**We have developed a machine learning model** to solve the challange. The steps are described below:-

### Signal Processing
### Feature Extraction
### Classification
### Data reduction
### Model Description

## Key Benefits

The primary benefits that one can achieve from our **Machine Learning Model** are:-

- Reduces Power Consumption
- Improves Data Accuracy
- Predict Sysmic Activity
- Crutial for Building Safe Habitats on the Moon and Mars

## Data and Resources
**The project uses real seismic data from:**
- **Apollo Missions**: Lunar seismic data.
- **Mars InSight Lander**: Seismic data from Mars.

The datasets include continuous seismic records, catalogs of known seismic events, and test data for further analysis.

## Usage
**The Jupyter Notebook contains detailed instructions on how to run the seismic analysis and visualize the data.** You can modify the provided algorithms to enhance the detection of seismic quakes or use machine learning models for more complex analysis.

## Results
**Our model achieved significant accuracy in detecting seismic events from planetary data.** By applying signal processing techniques, we were able to reduce noise interference and identify previously unrecorded seismic events.

## Future Work
**We plan to:**
- Further optimize the energy efficiency of the algorithm for real-time onboard use in future space missions.
- Explore additional machine learning techniques to improve detection in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.
