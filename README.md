# CoSeismic
This project aims to simulate an energy-efficient algorithm for analyzing seismic data from space missions. By filtering noise and identifying seismic quakes on Mars and the Moon, we optimize energy use and improve data accuracy. The app will feature interactive graphics and real-time planetary data to support future space missions.
